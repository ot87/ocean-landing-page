A prototype of a page to offer services or products.

Built with `React` and `Material UI`.

Contains a custom contact form that utilizes default HTML validation.

The form is controlled by `useReducer`.

Fields are rendered with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary rerender of the form while changing one of the fields.
